# 01. History and Motivation

Continuous Integration (CI) has dramatically transformed the way we build, test, and deliver software. What once took weeks or months is now handled in minutes — all thanks to decades of innovation in tooling and process.

## Speed of Software Delivery over Time

The time between writing and shipping software has shrunk drastically over the decades:

| Era             | Delivery Method               | Turnaround Time        |
|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| 🧮 1960s–70s      | **Punch cards / Mainframes**    | Days to weeks          |
| 💾 1980s–90s      | **Floppy disks, CDs**          | Monthly to yearly      |
| 🌐 2000s          | **Server deployments**         | Weekly to quarterly    |
| ☁️ 2010s–Now      | **CI/CD pipelines & cloud**     | Multiple times per day |
